         this case it includes the price. It is easier
         to allow the user to just say "Tap Espresso",
         rather than "Tap Espresso, Â£2.00".

         Note: From iOS 18, <name> is also by default,
         the subset of words from the beginning of the
         accessibility label. So in this case, it is
         not strictly necessary for iOS 18+.
